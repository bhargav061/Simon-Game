# Simon-Game
In this game, the program creates a series of texts (that indicates names of 4 different colors) and requires user to repeat the sequence. 
If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over. 
This game is made using just Java, Data Structures and Algorithms and without graphics.
